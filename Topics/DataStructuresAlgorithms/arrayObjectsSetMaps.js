// data structure and algorithm

// why data structrue
// think i have a phone book and the data is not sorted then i will search one by one to get the specific user, it will take time to search a specific name call it piyush
// but if i sort that data with respect to the alphabets and then find it then it will take less time for it

// no if i have sorted the data and im searching then what will happpen is that it will take time cuz it will search p in the array of whole alphabets then i then y so it will take alot of time so
// for this problem we have always to choose the best alogrithm for find the best time complexity

// data types and data structures
// there are two types
// linear data structure, non linear data structure

// linear is that in which data is in linear form or in the form of one after another like in array
// non-linear is that datat is stored in non-linear data structure like in herarichal form or graph method

// space and time complexity
// its a function that how manay time a funtion takes to execute code with respect to its input
// space complexity measures how manay space or memory a code takes to process that input

// there are 3 ways for time and space complexity
//  big - 0                                         theta - 0                      omega - 0
//  its the worst case senario that                 normal one/ mid one            smallest one
//  the most time and space a code can take to
//  measure the input

// now there are some big-o notataions and they are the most widely used notation cuz people normally but always use this way for measuring the time and space complexity

//  constant - 0(1)
//  linear - 0(n)
//  log - 0(log n)
//  quad - 0(n^2)
//  cubic - 0(n^3)

// just an example of constant - 0(1)
// const array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
//  console.log(array1[0])
// so doesnt matter how big the input is it will always takes constant time and space to execute that code
//  we can't measure exact execution time, but we can measure how the time grows relative to input size, which is what time complexity represents.
